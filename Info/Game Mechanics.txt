	*Merchant
		-Affiliation is based off previous quest work and using a merchant's shop
			-buying more stuff and doing quests for them will unlock more items and better sell/buy prices
		-Some items cost more depending on locations, season
		-stores have city specific items and some are level specific
			-Some merchants may notice your gear type and offer you special gear just like it that is more powerful then their usual stock (based off affilitaion)
		-unique scaled quest items(talking to merchant they can tell you where to go)
			-random chance for merchant knowing or just encounter when traveling
			-Based off your affiliation they may mention it when you approach them or you'd have to ask for it
			-trust is based off of previous work with merchant
		-Later game will require more money (need to do merchant work or guild quests)
	*Crafting
		-item crafting(crafting materials can be bought or found in quests)
			-increases quality with experience, starts off really bad
		-Cooking food gives you better stat buffs and health regen
			-Making meals is even better
			-This is linked to a skill that later on will allow you to treat your own food to preserve it
			-Can only be done at a tent/camp/city
			-Cooking food isn't always available based off what camp is being used, small/large, but is always available in a city if you pay for access to the kitchen.
			-Cooking can also be done at your home if you are there
			-Buffs are enhanced based of your race and what foods you like
*Countries
	-Some contries will try to kill you and you'll be on the run
	-Main city located in country 2, 4 and 5, Country 1 will have 4 of these cities
		-Can takeover the main city to take over the whole country at once, however this is harder
			-This is done when joining the Queen's country
	-Can team up with country 3 to take down 4 with the Queen's army
*Companions
	-Companions equal to your level the whole way through
		-They will return to their homes and can swap them out at those locations
		-If you buy a house you can keep a set amount of companions there
*Combat/skills/stats
	-Stat scaling:
		-Strength - Melee attack and slight HP
		-Perception - viewing enemy details and warnings before major battles
			-low stat may cause you to hit the wrong enemy
		-Endurance - Max AP, max HP, slight melee attack
		-Charisma - npc dialog checks, better prices
		-Intelligence - magic attack requirements, magic damamge, max mana
		-Agility - AP regain, dodging attacks
		-Luck - dialog checks, quest/battle rewards
		-Stat scaling is based of race and class
		-Stats affects the change per level of your starting characteristics
		-An elf gets more of a boost from a point in intelligence than a human would due to the stat multiplier affecting the change to the starting characteristics that the stats make
	-Stat effects scale with level
	-AP is required to attack
		-Turn order is based of AP regeneration and is not linear
		-Low AP against a high AP enemy may mean you die before getting to attack
	-Can't eat food during combat but can you potions
*Extra
	-Time and date system
		-The longer you take the stronger the Queen's army will become.
		-Untreated food will go off unless the player treats it

	-Random encounters when traveling between cities (fight/quest)
		-battle encounter more likely on foot and can only travel 1 town at a time
		-buy your own horse which decreases liklihood of encounters and travel 2 towns at once, hire cart to futher decrease the chances and to travel 3 towns at once
		-hire bodyguards to further decrease chances of encounter
		-some towns are really far and can only be visited via horse or cart
	-Multiple character saves, completely seperate, can't party up
