Story Line:
Basic storyline ATM
    Travel to a new town looking for a fresh start, slowly hear about the plot of a queen to takeover all the towns with her army of devoted citizens who she has casted a mass adoration spell on her kingdom(she’s an enchantress).  She wants to become ruler of all the other kingdoms and their subjects, everyone who has tried to stop her ended up dead or enchanted.  The closer to her kingdom you get the more brainwashed people there are and they will try and indoctrinate anyone who doesn’t adore the queen(or kill if you resist too much and you’re too close to her kingdom). The spell is very strong and you need high intelligence or a charm to protect you.  If without proper protection then you can be convinced to help the queen take over and will need to fight the armies.
What is the end goal?
    -Going out looking for an advenure at first
    -Finds out the plot of a queen and wants to stop her
    -Backstory of why you left is based off of class, early play decisions, hinted in story
Multiple endings
    -Get charmed by the queen and join her
    -“Join” her and betray her
    -Take over the kingdoms yourself
    -Fight the Queen
        -Kill her
        -Imprison her
    -Redemption from backstory(depends on class)

Game Mechanics:
    -Get to the new town and talk to guards, tell them you're an adventurer, they say prove it.
        -First quest: fight 5 animals around
    -you have tent checkpoints, some are temporary quest specific areas
    -Must complete quests to initally enter a new town
    -stores have city specific items and some are level specific
    -random encounters when traveling between cities (fight/quest)
        -battle encounter more likely on foot and can only travel 1 town at a time
        -buy your own horse which decreases liklihood of encounters and travel 2 towns at once, hire cart to futher decrease the chances and to travel 3 towns at once
        -hire bodyguards to further decrease chances of encounter
        -some towns are really far and can only be visited via horse or cart
    -guild quests/town
    -tavern fights/jail
    -some items cost more depending on locations(can do merchant stuff)
    -Later game will require more money (need to do merchant work or guild quests)
    -unique scaled quest items(talking to merchant they can tell you where to go)
        -random chance for merchant knowing or just encounter when traveling
        -some just flat out mention it some you need to ask based off of trust
        -trust is based off of previous work with merchant
    -multiple characters, completely seperate, can't party up
        -other characters can be referenced in story
    -No online play
    -possible perma-death on final story battle
    -post-story side content
    -item crafting(crafting materials can be bought or found in quests)
        -increases quality with experience, starts off really bad
    -companions eaual to your level the whole way through
        -set locations and can swap them out at those locations
        -if you buy a house you can keep a set amount of companions there
    -When you near the kingdom of the queen, players will be warned subtly by merchants w/ good relationship
        -are advised to have protection charm or high intelligence to avoid being charmed
        -if they still go without those things they can be charmed and convinced to join and assist the queen
        -would then be forced to go back to the other towns/kingdoms with the queen’s men and fight the armies/guards there
            -Possible perma death scenario due to lose of control
